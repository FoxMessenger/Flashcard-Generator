# Flashcard-Generator
A flash card building app 

This flashcard-Generator uses Inquirer.js to ask the user, in Commandline/Terminal, a series of questions, and then check those against an answer.

The basic function version I have physically omitted the information I wanted to not be seen.
The advanced function version I have created a method to remove the source of information I do not want seen.

further study would be to allow user input to create unique cards.
